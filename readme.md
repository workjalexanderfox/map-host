# map-host
This repository contains a script to easily set map a "host" name to a "host" ip in  ```/etc/hosts``` and ```~/.ssh/config``` and can also place your ```~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``` onto the "host" machine in one simple command:

```
map-host.sh -k -a sshHost -n host.kroger.com -i 192.168.0.1
```

This is useful for creating VMs and automatically setting up a "Poor Man's" DNS, with the added benefit of placing RSA keys on the "host" for quick access to the host.
